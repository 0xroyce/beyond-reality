# Contributing to Beyond Reality

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-theory`)
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add quantum tunneling detection'`)
4. Push to branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-theory`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use clear variable names reflecting quantum/physics concepts
- Include detailed comments explaining theoretical principles
- Add unit tests for new algorithms
- Follow PEP 8 style for Python code

### Documentation
- Explain the theoretical background of your implementation
- Include relevant physics/quantum mechanics equations
- Add references to academic papers or research
- Document limitations and assumptions

### Project Scope
We welcome contributions in:
- Quantum mechanics algorithms
- Simulation theory detection
- Consciousness and reality modeling
- Spacetime manipulation concepts
- Information theory applications

### Ethical Considerations
- Clearly mark theoretical vs. proven concepts
- Include appropriate warnings for experimental features
- Respect scientific method and peer review principles
